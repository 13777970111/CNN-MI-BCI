# Introduction

CNN-SAE program for MI-BCI classification. (Based on "A novel deep learning approach for classification of EEG motor imagery signals")

- Please fellow the lisense of rasmusbergpal when use this program.

- CNN-SAE(MI-BCI) is a matlab progam for the classification Motor Imagery EEG signals.

- CNN-SAE(MI-BCI) programed based on rasmusbergpal [DeepLearnToolbox](https://github.com/rasmusbergpalm/DeepLearnToolbox.git.)

- The theory of this program based on [Tabar et al-2016-J Neural Eng](https://doi.org/10.1088/1741-2560/14/1/016003). Also, we have make some changes in it to improve the result.

- This performance of this program is based on [BCI Competioion IV dataset 2a](http://www.bbci.de/competition/iv/)(click here for more information).

# Notice

Before you run the program, you should first run ***biosig_installer.m*** in biosig4octmat-3.2.0. This is an opern-source toolbox [BioSig](http://biosig.sourceforge.net/) for loading the GDF file of the dataset.
